1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990
 Here's the deal. If

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,480
 a company is underpaying

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,400
 you, you know it

4
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,400
 and you believe you

5
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,440
 have some level of,

6
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,130
 hey, this is what

7
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,000
 is happening. For

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,740
 me, it's really

9
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,310
 hard to want to

10
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,170
 stay at that job

11
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:09,800
 because that means

12
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,720
 they don't value

13
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,120
 you.

14
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,970
 They value your

15
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,170
 work only. I would

16
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,310
 strongly suggest

17
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,520
 using your current

18
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,930
 experience as a way

19
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:17,980
 to leverage a good

20
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,120
 position elsewhere.

21
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,880
 And I wouldn't even

22
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,600
 try for competing

23
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,430
 off. I know people

24
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:21,760
 are saying

25
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,420
 competing offers

26
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:22,960
 are good way.

27
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,800
 Competing offers

28
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,600
 are a great way to

29
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,410
 show that you have

30
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,340
 more value, but

31
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,300
 competing offers

32
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,160
 are also a great

33
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,880
 way for you to

34
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,360
 build.

35
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,840
 A lot of angst and

36
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,310
 anxiety against you

37
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,790
 in such a way that,

38
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,260
 yeah, they'll be

39
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,030
 like, Oh, yeah, we

40
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,640
 really love you.

41
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,320
 Come on in.

42
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,060
 They'll pay you

43
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,900
 more. And then at

44
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,550
 the end of the day

45
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,430
 in six months, you're

46
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,950
 going to get your

47
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,610
 ass fired because

48
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,310
 you just put a huge

49
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,120
 target on your back.
